<p>(A).
Upon matching of a trade effected on or pursuant to the rules of the Exchange, the Exchange shall promptly submit to FreightTrust Clearing a trade report generated by the electronic trading system of the Exchange.
The report shall show for each trade</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>(B).
If FreightTrust Clearing determines that any trade report submitted pursuant to this Rule 401 contains a material error or is otherwise not eligible for clearing by FreightTrust Clearing, FreightTrust Clearing may reject such trade and notify the Exchange of such rejection, setting forth the basis of such objection.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>(a) The submission of a Contract (Smart Contract or a Normal Contract) to FreightTrust Clearing by or on behalf of the buying and selling Clearing Participants shall constitute a request, by such Clearing Participants, for the clearing of such Contract by FreightTrust Clearing. Upon the acceptance thereof by FreightTrust Clearing, which ordinarily shall be deemed to occur upon the receipt of matched trade data from the Exchange, the Contract shall be novated and FreightTrust Clearing shall be substituted as, and assume the position of, seller to the Clearing Participant buying such Contract and buyer from the Clearing Participant selling such Contract. Upon such substitution, such buying and selling Clearing Participants shall be released from their obligations to each other, and FreightTrust Clearing shall be deemed to have succeeded to all the rights, and  to have assumed all the Obligations, of the Clearing Participants that were party to such Contract, in each case as provided in the Rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(b) Where an FCM Clearing Participant and/or Network Participant acts to clear a Contract made for the account of a Customer, the FCM Clearing Participant becomes obligated to FreightTrust Clearing, and FreightTrust Clearing becomes obligated to the FCM Clearing Participant, with respect to such Contract in the same manner and to the same extent as if the Contract were for the account of the FCM Clearing Participant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), a trade shall not be accepted for clearing, and FreightTrust Clearing shall not be substituted for a given Contract, unless the Margin for such Contract is made available to FreightTrust Clearing, by or for both Clearing Participants, pursuant to Rule 403.</p>

<p>(a) Each Network and Clearing Participant SHALL deposit funds or Collateral in the form of the applicable quantity of the deliverable underlying commodity and/or deliverable asset required to fully collateralize orders pursuant to the contract specifications contained in the Rulebook, including payment of premiums, payment in exchange for delivery or to fulfill delivery obligations, as applicable, prior to submission of such orders to the Exchange. Fund and Collateral transfers made by a Clearing Participant to the Clearinghouse or by the Clearinghouse to a Clearing Participant are irrevocable and unconditional when effected. The Clearing Participant shall be responsible for all fees associated with wires or transfers of Collateral to the Clearinghouse.</p>

<p>(c) Funds and Collateral must be and remain unencumbered. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Clearing Participant posting funds or Collateral hereby grants to the Clearinghouse a first priority security interest in and unencumbered lien against any Margin, Contracts, positions and other funds, property and any other Collateral deposited with the Clearinghouse by the Clearing Participant, including without limitation such Clearing Participant’s Member Property Accounts, the Customer Accounts of such Clearing Participant’s Customers, and all securities entitlements held therein. A Clearing Participant shall execute any documents required by FreightTrust Clearing to create, perfect and enforce such  lien. Each Clearing Participant hereby agrees that with respect to any funds or Collateral which is or may be credited to the Clearing Participant’s Member Property Account or Customer Account, as applicable, the Clearinghouse shall have control pursuant to Section 9-106(a) and 8-106(e) of the UCC and a perfected security interest pursuant to Section 9-314(a) of the UCC.</p>

<p>(d) FreightTrust Clearing may assign, pledge, repledge or otherwise create a lien on or security interest in, and enter into repurchase agreements involving, Margin, Contracts, positions and other funds, property and any other Collateral deposited with the Clearinghouse by the Clearing Participant, as permitted by CFTC Regulations, held in or for such Clearing Participant’s Member Property Accounts or the Customer Accounts of such Clearing Participant’s Customers to secure the repayment of funds that may be borrowed by FreightTrust Clearing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(e) Clearing Participant must transfer the funds and Collateral to the Clearinghouse which will hold funds and Collateral on behalf of the Clearing Participant. FreightTrust Clearing will credit to the Clearing Participant the funds and Collateral that such Clearing Participant deposits. Funds and Collateral shall be held by the Clearinghouse until a Clearing Participant submits a withdrawal notification, unless otherwise stipulated by these Rules. FreightTrust Clearing will not be responsible for any diminution in value of funds or Collateral that a Clearing Participant deposits with the Clearinghouse, except, in the case of cash, the diminution of value is as a direct result of investment activity of the Clearinghouse, such activity having been conducted in full compliance with CFTC Regulations. Any fluctuation in markets is the risk of each Clearing Participant. Any interest earned on Clearing Participant funds or Collateral may be retained by the Clearinghouse.</p>

Such investments shall be for the account and risk of FreightTrust Clearing, and any income and gains on such investments and interest on such deposits shall belong to FreightTrust Clearing and may be withdrawn from the account holding the Margin and deposited with the general funds of FreightTrust Clearing.</p>

A Clearing Participant shall be required to pay the loss or entitled to collect the profit, as the case may be, upon such offsetting transactions, and shall have no further rights or be under any further obligation with respect thereto.

<p>As used in the Rules, the term &#8220;Settlement Price&#8221; means the settlement price for a Contract for which positions remain open, as determined, intra-day and at the close of regular trading hours, by the Exchange in accordance with its rules, except in the case of manifest error or where FreightTrust Clearing believes that such settlement price does not reasonably reflect the value or price of the Contract, in which case FreightTrust Clearing, using its best efforts to consult with the Exchange, shall determine the official Settlement Price;
provided, that FreightTrust Clearing shall in such circumstances promptly notify the Exchange and Clearing Participants, and the reasons for that determination and the basis for the Settlement Price determined by FreightTrust Clearing shall be published in a notice to the Exchange and Clearing Participants.</p>
