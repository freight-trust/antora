===</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[1] PROTEST An importer may challenge a CBP decision using an administrative procedure set out in 19 U.S.C.
§ 1514.
CBP provides a standardized form, Form 19, but it is not required if the challenge meets certain statutory criteria.
For more information about protests, see Practice Note, Importing Goods into the US: Overview: Challenging CBP Decisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[2] CUSTOMS POWER OF ATTORNEY A customs power of attorney gives the customs broker legal authority to act as the importer&#8217;s agent related to customs business, including: Preparing and filing documents with CBP.
Classifying and providing values for imported goods.
Paying tariffs, duties, and other charges that CBP collects on imports.
The power of attorney recites the specific activities the customs broker is authorized to conduct on the importer&#8217;s behalf, which should be consistent with the services set out in this agreement.
CBP regulations contain a sample general power of attorney (19 C.F.R.
§ 141.32), but the CBP form is unlimited and may authorize the customs broker to do more than the importer needs or wants it to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[4] FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS This provision favors the importer, but the customs broker may insist on including language: Allowing it to adjust fees unilaterally if its rates generally change.
Stating that the customs broker is not obligated to advance any funds on the importer&#8217;s behalf and instead that the importer must prepay any anticipated or required disbursements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[5] INVOICING AND PAYMENT This Standard Document contemplates an ongoing relationship between the importer and the customs broker and calls for regular (typically monthly) invoicing and payment.
For importers desiring infrequent or one-off customs brokerage services, an ad hoc invoicing procedure, with the customs broker issuing its invoice on completion of the services, may be more suitable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The importer should include the bracketed term "undisputed" in the second sentence to allow it to withhold payment of disputed charges.
The customs broker should try to exclude the term.
For information about payment terms, see Standard Clause, General Contract Clauses: Payment Terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[10] SECURITY The Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) is a program established by CBP after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.
It allows importers committing to specified supply chain security practices to receive certain benefits from CBP, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fewer CBP inspections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shorter wait times for inspections at the borders.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The importer should include this optional provision if it is a CTPAT member, because it must ensure that its supply chain business partners, including its customs brokers, either:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Are CTPAT members.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have processes in place to ensure compliance with the CBP&#8217;s published minimum security requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An importer that is not a CTPAT member may include this provision as well if it wishes.
In addition to including Section 10 in this in this agreement, the importer should also obtain back-up documents from the broker confirming these representations and warranties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[12] ASSIGNMENT;
SUCCESSORS Anti-assignment clauses are included in agreements to restrict the parties' ability to assign their rights under the agreement, often by requiring the non-assigning party&#8217;s prior written consent.
Include the bracketed language at the end of the first sentence if a party wants to ensure the other party cannot withhold, condition, or delay its consent unreasonably.
Assignment clauses also often deal with the parties' ability to delegate their obligations.
The second sentence is included to render any assignment in violation of the section ineffective.
Without this sentence, the non-assigning party may have only a breach of contract claim, but the assignment to a third party may remain effective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[13] INDEMNIFICATION This provision favors the importer by requiring the customs broker to indemnify it against claims arising from the customs broker&#8217;s breach of the agreement or negligence.
The customs broker should try to negotiate a reciprocal indemnification from the importer for claims it may face arising from: Inaccurate information the importer provides (see Section 6).
Other claims, losses, and liabilities relating to the import or export of the importer&#8217;s goods.
Other indemnities may be included in an accompanying transportation or freight forwarding agreement.</p>
